        <h2 class="main_header">Gallus</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The gallus commonly dwell in small, familial communities as opposed to the grand
                perches of the Wood. Of the
                birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the
                humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love
                of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their
                social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their
                neighbors and promote the common good. They are polite but
                have little patience for deceit and rudeness.</p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">A Varied Folk.</span> The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many
                different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are
                pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble
                chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers,
                colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace.
                The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point
                of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a
                knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself.
                Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the
                gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to
                include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus
                culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to
                guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children’s story about a meal growing too
                cold to eat as the gallus continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party.</p>
            <p> <span class="bold italic">Salt of the Earth.</span> Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form
                close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense
                of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves
                children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus
                families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as
                farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all
                community members. There is nothing a gallus would not give
                to their neighbors in a time of need.
                While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for
                their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal
                skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point
                of being socially exploitable. The gallus have an ear
                for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies
                and dishonesty.</p>

            <h2 class="main_header">Gallus Traits</h2>
            <ul class="race_traits">
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Age.</strong> While ages fluctuate, gallus reach maturity around 18 
                    and can live anywhere between 70 and 100 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Most gallus are lawful good. They are a salt-of-the-earth sort of folk who believe in justice, the value of hard 
                    work, and the importance of respecting others.</li>
                <li><strong>Size.</strong> Gallus are the most varied of the birdfolk races, ranging from just under 4 feet to just over 5 feet tall, and showing 
                    many unique builds. The variety of shapes and sizes means 
                    they also encompass a variety of weights, but most average 
                    around 90 pounds. Your size is Medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Glide.</strong> Using your feathered arms, you can slow your 
                    fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your 
                    reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and 
                    slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently 
                    at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when 
                    you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may 
                    fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, 
                    although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in 
                    the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while 
                    carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may 
                    drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your 
                    arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you 
                    are encumbered. </li>
                <li><strong>Wing Flap.</strong> As a bonus action, you can use your powerful 
                    feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to 
                    half your movement speed. You can use it in conjunction with 
                    a regular jump, but not while gliding.</li>
                <li><strong>Communal.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) 
                    check related to the history of your race, culture, or community, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add 
                    double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your 
                    normal proficiency bonus. </li>
                <li><strong>Militia Training.</strong> You have proficiency in simple weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Of the People.</strong> You gain proficiency with the artisan 
                    tools of your choice: brewer’s supplies, carpenter’s tools, or 
                    smith’s tools. </li>
                <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk. 
                    You can also understand Auran, though you cannot speak 
                    it naturally. </li>
                <li><strong>Subrace.</strong> There are two main subraces of gallus: bright and 
                    huden. Choose one of these subraces.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Bright Gallus</h3>
            <p class="bold italic">As a bright gallus, you are a natural leader. Growing up 
                in your close-knit community has taught you how to inspire 
                others and rally folks to a common cause. This air of command 
                follows you wherever you roam.</p>
            <ul class="race_traits">
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspiring.</strong> By spending an action and giving words of 
                    advice or encouragement, you can inspire an ally who is able 
                    to see and hear you. The ally can roll a d4 and add the number 
                    rolled to their next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. </li>
                <li><strong>Understanding.</strong> You have proficiency in the Insight skill.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Huden Gallus</h3>
            <p class="bold italic">As a huden gallus, you are of the land. Like the Amaranthine Hanera, you have a unique connection to the Great 
                Rhythm of nature, and in return the Rhythm grants you many 
                gifts. This innate bond with nature may alienate you from city 
                life, but you will always have a home within the more remote 
                parts of the Wood.</p>
            <ul class="race_traits">
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>One With the Wood.</strong> You have proficiency in the 
                    Nature skill.</li>
                <li><strong>Seedspeech.</strong> Your connection to the Great Rhythm is 
                    such that you can speak with the greenery of the forest itself. 
                    Through speech and touch you can communicate simple ideas 
                    to living plants. You are able to interpret their responses 
                    in simple language. Plants in the Wood do not experience 
                    the world in terms of sight, but most can feel differences 
                    in temperature, describe things that have touched them, 
                    as well as hear vibrations that happened around them 
                    (including speech).</li>

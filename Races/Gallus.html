        <h2 class="main_header">Gallus</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The gallus commonly dwell in small, familial communities as opposed to the grand
                perches of the Wood. Of the
                birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the
                humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love
                of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their
                social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their
                neighbors and promote the common good. They are polite but
                have little patience for deceit and rudeness.</p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">A Varied Folk.</span> The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many
                different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are
                pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble
                chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers,
                colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace.
                The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point
                of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a
                knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself.
                Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the
                gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to
                include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus
                culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to
                guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children’s story about a meal growing too
                cold to eat as the gallus continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party.</p>
            <p> <span class="bold italic">Salt of the Earth.</span> Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form
                close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense
                of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves
                children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus
                families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as
                farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all
                community members. There is nothing a gallus would not give
                to their neighbors in a time of need.
                While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for
                their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal
                skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point
                of being socially exploitable. The gallus have an ear
                for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies
                and dishonesty.</p>

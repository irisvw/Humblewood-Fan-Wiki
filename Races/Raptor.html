        <h2 class="main_header">Raptor</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>When the birdfolk think of hunters or rangers, they picture 
                a raptor. Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of 
                prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them 
                effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift 
                and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely 
                prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.</p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">Perceptive Awareness</span> Given their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be 
                distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the 
                wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only 
                ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have 
                an extremely wide field of awareness. <br>
                Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled 
                hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for 
                their perches. Raptors are especially well versed in stalking prey 
                from great heights, lining up impossible shots that their prey 
                could not predict. </p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">Natural Predator</span> While many of the birdfolk races are culturally communal, 
                raptors donâ€™t have a great sense of connectedness, nor do they 
                tend to create their own perches. They are more likely to adopt 
                a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply 
                live in the vast forests of the Wood itself. <br>
                Though typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming 
                relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature, 
                raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even 
                familial ties.</p>

        <h2 class="main_header">Corvum</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p class="bold italic">Corvums are a crow-like race with dark feathers and sharp
                minds. Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short
                of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of
                any given situation. It’s hard to say whether the corvums are
                distrusted because they behave the way they do, or if they
                behave the way they do because they are distrusted. <br>
                It is widely believed that corvums only look out for themselves. Sometimes this presents as flexible
                morals, and at other
                times it simply means they follow a personal code instead of
                subscribing to general law. Either way, corvums are a crafty
                race and they tend to get what they want, one way or another.
                Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum
                of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they
                face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a
                position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working
                behind the scenes, spreading their influence subtly and to
                great effect.<br>
                Corvums are commonly accepted, sometimes begrudgingly, to be among the smartest of birdfolk. Keen
                observers,
                they trade in information the way others trade goods. They
                are hungry for knowledge and leverage it to further their goals
                whenever possible. Their undeniable skill in matters of logistics
                and planning make them valuable to councils and powerful
                individuals alike

            <ul class="race_traits">
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Intelligence score
                    increases by 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Age.</strong> Corvums reach adulthood at around 18 years.
                    They live slightly shorter lives than other birdfolk,
                    approximately 70 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Shrewd and capable, corvums prefer moral
                    flexibility and are more likely to be neutral than either good
                    or evil. Nonetheless, corvums see the benefit of rules, even if
                    many attempt to turn them to their own advantage. Because of
                    this they favor lawful alignments.</li>
                <li><strong>Size.</strong> Corvums cut imposing figures, standing between 4
                    and a half and 5 and a half feet tall, encompassing a variety
                    of different builds. They weigh around 100 pounds. Your size
                    is Medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Glide.</strong> Using your feathered arms, you can slow your
                    fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your
                    reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and
                    slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently
                    at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when
                    you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may
                    fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose,
                    although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in
                    the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while
                    carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may
                    drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your
                    arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you
                    are encumbered.</li>
                <li><strong>Talons.</strong> Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and
                    while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4
                    piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength
                    (Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could
                    reasonably grip.</li>
                <li><strong>Learned.</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following
                    skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.</li>
                <li><strong>Appraising Eye.</strong> You have an almost supernatural ability to
                    appraise objects. By spending an action examining any object,
                    you can determine any magical properties the item has, how
                    they might be used or activated, as well as a fair estimation of
                    market price. Using this skill strains the eyes, and you must
                    complete a long or short rest before you can use it again.</li>
                <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk.
                    You can also understand Auran, though you cannot speak
                    it naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Subrace.</strong> There are two main subraces of corvum:
                    dusk and kindled. Choose one of these subraces.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Dusk Corvum</h3>
            <p class="bold italic">As a dusk corvum, you are more at home in the bustle
                of society than in the wilds of the forest. You understand
                subtle social cues the way a hunter understands
                their prey, and you’re just as quick to capitalize on
                an advantage.</p>
            <ul class="race_traits">
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score
                    increases by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Skulker.</strong> You have advantage on
                    Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in dim
                    light or darkness.</li>
                <li><strong>Street Smarts.</strong> You gain proficiency
                    in the Insight skill.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Kindled Corvum</h3>
            <p class="bold italic">As a kindled corvum, you know implicitly that you are
                the smartest in the room. Your ability to utilize your knowledge to your advantage, along with your deep
                understanding
                of others motivations, makes you a formidable opponent.</p>
            <ul class="race_traits">
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score
                    increases by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Convincing.</strong> Kindled corvums have a way with words,
                    and are accomplished at saying what someone wants or
                    needs to hear. You have proficiency in either the Deception
                    or Persuasion skill. Additionally, you have advantage on
                    all Charisma checks made to convince someone of your
                    exceptional knowledge on any topic related to the skill you
                    selected with your learned trait (Arcana, History, Nature,
                    or Religion).</li>
                <li><strong>Sharp Mind.</strong> You learn one additional language
                    of your choice, gain proficiency in a tool of your
                    choice, and are able to accurately recall with
                    perfect clarity anything you have seen or
                    heard within the past month.</li>

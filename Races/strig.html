        <div class="main_body">
            <p>Strigs are the most imposing of the birdfolk races. Resembling owls, their thick feathers, solid bodies, and broad wings 
                have earned them a reputation as the most powerful of the 
                birdfolk races. They value strength and endurance, traits they 
                believe crucial for survival in the Wood. Although they are not 
                necessarily prejudiced against those who are weaker, strigs are 
                quick to call out when someone is not doing their best for the 
                common good.</p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">Strong and Brave</span> While many birdfolk rely on their prowess or intelligence 
                for superiority, strigs use their immense strength and stamina 
                to endure even the most punishing assault. They make mighty 
                warriors, and whether defending their perch or braving the 
                Wood itself, strigs never shy away from a fight.<br>
                Strig culture is largely based on principles of strength 
                and endurance above all, but not necessarily for the purposes 
                of combat. Protecting and providing for others in hard 
                times is considered just as impressive, if not more so, than 
                winning a fight.</p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">Woodland Survivors</span> Strigs, more than any of the other birdfolk race, are most at 
                home in the wild. Their mottled feather patterns, though not 
                as bright or beautiful as others, allow them to easily hide in the 
                forest. Due to this inherent advantage, along with their speed 
                and power, strigs make excellent hunters and rangers. <br>
                Strigs prefer the relative simplicity of the forest to the 
                machinations of society and politics. Despite these individualistic tendencies, they are capable of forming familial 
                and community bonds that transcend a permanent or single 
                physical home.</p>

            <h2 class="main_header">Strig Traits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Age.</strong> Strigs reach maturity faster than most birdfolk races, 
                    around 15 years. They can reach a respectable old age by birdfolk standards, living around 80 years. </li>
                <li><strong>Alignment.</strong> Strigs are normally good aligned, having a 
                    strong sense of fair play as well as a tendency to see the best in 
                    others. They also favor chaotic alignments, as strigs are a freedom-loving people who will usually put their personal morals 
                    above any imposed system of governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Size.</strong> Strigs are muscular, imposing folk ranging from 4 
                    to over 5 feet tall and weighing around 110 pounds. Your size 
                    is Medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Glide.</strong> Using your feathered arms, you can slow your 
                    fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your 
                    reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and 
                    slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently 
                    at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when 
                    you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may 
                    fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, 
                    although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in 
                    the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while 
                    carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may 
                    drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your 
                    arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you 
                    are encumbered.</li>
                <li><strong>Talons.</strong> Your sharp claws aid you in unarmed combat and 
                    while climbing. Your damage for an unarmed strike is 1d4 
                    piercing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength 
                    (Athletics) checks made to climb any surface your talons could 
                    reasonably grip.</li>
                <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You are adept at hunting under the cover of 
                    night. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it 
                    were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You 
                    canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </li>
                <li><strong>Patterned Feathers.</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity 
                    (Stealth) checks when you attempt to hide in a forest. </li>
                <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk. 
                    You can also understand Auran, though you cannot speak 
                    it naturally. </li>
                <li><strong>Subrace.</strong> There are two main subraces of strigs: swift 
                    and stout. Choose one of these subraces.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Stout Strig</h3>
            <p class="bold italic">As a stout strig, you are as hearty as you are strong, able 
                to weather hardship and impose your will on the world 
                around you. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score 
                    increases by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Imposing.</strong> You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</li>
                <li><strong>Brawler.</strong> When you successfully attack a target 
                    with your talons, you can choose to grapple that 
                    target as a bonus action.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Swift Strig</h3>
            <p class="bold italic">As a swift strig, you are a powerful 
                force in the Wood who ranges far and 
                wide without ever missing a step. You 
                are most capable when immersed in 
                the forest. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your 
                    Dexterity score increases by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Swift.</strong> Your base walking speed 
                    increases to 35 feet. </li>
                <li><strong>Survivor.</strong> You have proficiency 
                    in the Survival skill.</li>
            </ul>

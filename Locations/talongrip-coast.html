        <h2 class="main_header">Talongrip Coast</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The perches of Talongrip Coast stand in stark contrast
                to their woodland counterparts, often rising from cliff faces,
                salt-blasted trees, and jagged rocks jutting from the sea. These
                small settlements are sparsely decorated, focusing on stability
                and protection from the salty winds of the ocean. Homes are
                chiseled out of the rock faces, with wooden platforms serving
                as walkways between them. On more vertical slopes, buildings
                are connected by a veritable forest of ropes and cables used to
                get from place to place.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Life Over the Water</h4>
            <p>Citizens of coastal perches and villages are primarily folk
                who wish to remain close to the water. Sea raptors, mapachs,
                and jerbeens have carved out space for themselves along the
                coast, sometimes literally. These seaside settlements focus on
                fishing and salt drying, exporting their cured fish to the rest of
                the Wood.</p>
            <p>The weather here is volatile. It can turn from clear and
                sunny to black and stormy with one gust of the wind. Most of
                the coastâ€™s inhabitants can spot these changes easily, knowing
                when to retreat to shelters. Living near the shore means enduring the occasional hurricane, windstorm,
                and tidal wave. Those
                who make the coast their home are known for resilience.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Deadly Neighbors</h4>
            <p>A number of dangers face the people who live along the
                coastline. Large predatory lizards hunt and scavenge the sandy
                shores, and giant crabs have been known to drag victims to a
                watery grave. Rarest of all are the dreaded wakewyrms. Most
                professional fishing outfits employ hunters to stand guard, and
                guides and mercenaries are often hired by merchants hauling
                goods across the treacherous coastways. Those who wish to
                avoid the cost of protection can attempt the journey alone, but
                many grim fables describe foolish travelers who were too stingy
                to take the proper precautions.</p>

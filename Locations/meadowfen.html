            <p>Meadowfen is a peaceful village located between the Mokk
                Fields to the south and a glade of spruce copses to the north.
                It is a humble village, with a small number of residents. Most
                are farmers who work either the ash-enriched pastures to the
                north, or the marshlands to the south, which are ripe with sour
                berries and waterborne plants. Meadowfen has been quiet for
                as long as anyone can remember, and life here goes by slowly.
                Its closeness to the marsh keeps it safe from attacks by emberbats and other fire-based creatures from the Scorched Grove.
                Its distance from the Mokk Fields ensures deadly slimes don’t
                stray into the village. </p>

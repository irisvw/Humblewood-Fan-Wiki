            <p>History shows there was serious
                disagreement over the founding of Saltar’s
                Port. For many birdfolk, the idea of building a city on the ground is laughable in
                itself, but to build on the rocky coastline
                with the express intent of sailing ships was
                considered a gross misuse of resources.
                After heated debates, a group of birdfolk
                broke off and founded the port city on
                their own. The rift between the inhabitants
                of the Port and the rest of the Wood took
                many years to mend, and the relationship
                is still tense at times. </p>
            <p>Saltar’s Port serves as the only access for
                ships coming to or leaving from Humblewood. It has sparked a vibrant trade
                business, offering the riches of the Wood
                to faroff cities and kingdoms. The port has
                also opened up Humblewood to overseas
                visitors and migrants, causing concern
                among the more consevative birdfolk.</p>

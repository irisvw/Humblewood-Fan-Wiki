        <h2 class="main_header">The Avium</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The Avium is a college of magical arts with a wide range of
                subjects available for study. The free transmission of knowledge
                is one of the Avium’s core principles, but the College nonetheless maintains a certain degree of secrecy regarding some
                of the more dangerous magical tomes it safeguards. All races
                are welcome within the Avium’s halls, although admittance is
                granted only by the will of the headmaster and a council of
                senior staff. Prospective students are tested for their skills, but
                also the motivation for their studies. The College takes great
                care to ensure its members will positively represent the legacy
                and reputation of the Avium out in the world. </p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Magic, Inside and Out</h4>
            <p>The Avium was once a living tree that was home to a perch
                known for producing some of Humblewood’s most legendary
                scholars. After the tree’s death, a group of wizards from this
                perch decided to found the Avium here. They used transmutation magic to artificially petrify the tree, and then shaped
                it into a building capable of housing the largest mage college
                in Humblewood. Controlled by magical fields, the College’s
                many structures float in circuit with one another: a collection
                of towers, courtyards, and observatories all hover around the
                huge central building, each equipped with a bridge that lines
                up with the main building at regular intervals. Those not gifted
                with the birdfolk’s limited form of flight must harness their
                magic for transportation, or wait until the archways align to
                allow for foot traffic.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Seat of Knowledge</h4>
            <p>While the curriculum is diverse, the College does impose
                certain limitations, most notably regarding necromancy. As
                inhabitants of the Wood, the Avium’s primary staff members
                originate from a culture with great respect for nature and the
                cycle of life. As such, the necromantic arts are taught mainly in
                a theoretical sense. Practical application of necromancy at
                the College is highly regulated, and available only under
                strict guidance.</p>
            <p>Students are, however, encouraged to explore other schools
                of magic to their fullest potential. Breakthroughs in elemental
                theorems, teleportation methods, and advances in practical
                transmutation have been pioneered at the Avium. Within these
                classrooms you will find future Tenders, council members, and
                protectors of the Wood. The application process is demanding,
                and the curriculum rigorous. Few make it to graduation. For
                those who prove their grasp of the arcane, endorsement from
                the Avium is among the highest of honors.</p>

        <h2 class="main_header">The Crest</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The Crest is the name given to the mountain range to the
                northeast of Humblewood. It stands in stark contrast to the
                green forest at its base with sheer rock faces and huge boulders
                rising into the sky. </p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Desolate and Dangerous</h4>
            <p>The mountainâ€™s severe environment supports a variety of
                goats and small mammals that feast on hearty shrubbery growing between the crags. There are also several
                unique creatures
                native to the Crest. Griffons roost in the peaks
                and scour a wide territory around the mountain for prey. Basilisks feast on rocks, but have a special
                preference for
                creatures they have petrified with their deadly stone gaze.
                Giant eagles nest atop the highest cliffs, keeping their
                young safe from lowland predators. Mountain lions,
                powerful earth-aspected hunters, prey on goats, rodents,
                and occasionally more monstrous creatures. </p>
            <p>The Crest is dotted with structures built during different
                points in history by both birdfolk and humblefolk. In addition
                to garnering interest from archeological teams, some of these
                mysterious ruins have become home to a handful of intrepid
                folk who have taken to life in this dangerous and remote place.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Mighty Origins</h4>
            <p>An old tale relates how the Amaranthine Altus was challenged to a contest of strength by a giant made from living
                rock. To achieve victory, Altus is said to have lifted the earth
                up with his talons, proving his might and creating the mountains. In some versions, the frustrated giant challenges Altus
                to several rematches. They travel across the face of Everden,
                raising higher and higher peaks, until all the mountains in
                the world are created. Every adaptation agrees: Altus is always
                victorious, and is given dominion over the high summits of the
                world. The snowy, harsh environment of the mountains is said
                to be directly influenced by Altus, the Amaranthine of storms.</p>
            <p>It is a wonder that such a lush, expansive forest sits at the
                foot of these blustry peaks. Experts theorize that the formidable bulwark of rock helped the Wood thrive by shielding is
                from the bitter, salty winds of the ocean.</p>

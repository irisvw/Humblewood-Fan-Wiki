            <p>In the south of the forest is a small perch known as Marshview. One of the most unconventional perches, Marshview is
                extremely disconnected from the goings on of the Wood. The
                location has basic amenities, like shops and an inn, but it is not
                a prime destination for travelers. Residents eye visitors with a
                mix of curiosity and suspicion, but are ultimately a kind and
                welcoming folk.</p>
            <p>A balanced mix of birdfolk and humblefolk inhabitants
                results in architecture unique to Marshview. A reflection of its
                population, walkways and staircases are more common here
                than in other birdfolk settlements. Several buildings are on the
                ground, and traditional farming takes advantage of the limited
                dry ground between the forest and the nearby swamp.</p>

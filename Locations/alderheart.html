        <h2 class="main_header">Alderheart</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>Long ago, druids of the Wood learned how to speak with
                trees and use magic to shape them into shelters in which they
                could make their homes. This process was considered deeply
                respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape
                it didn’t agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as
                shapers, became mediators between the will of the people
                and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest
                and most ancient tree in the Wood—Alderheart. The shapers
                obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart’s branches. Later, the great tree
                again gave permission to
                shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This
                burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously
                provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart
                became Humblewood’s capital. Known throughout the region
                as the “Great Tree City,” Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a
                cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional
                and some from the farthest corners of Everden.
            </p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Heart of the Wood</h4>
            <p>Alderheart is home to every race of birdfolk and humblefolk. The thriving community attracts people from
                faraway
                lands, like traveling merchants, explorers, and foreign dignitaries. Citizens of the Humblewood who
                don’t live in the city
                routinely journey there to trade goods, stock up on supplies,
                engage in artistic endeavors, or simply to catch up on the
                latest news and gossip. Effectively everyone in Humblewood is
                connected to Alderheart.</p>
            <p>
                Virtually anything can be found in Alderheart, if you
                know where to look. The majority of the city’s inhabitants
                are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark
                alleys and back rooms. Crime here is usually kept in check by
                the Perch Guard, but while the city guards are vaunted as being
                among the best in the Wood, illicit activities continue under
                the cover of darkness.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Wide and Tall</h4>
            <p>As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to
                tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into
                three main levels where people live, work, and go about their
                lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.</p>
            <p> The canopy contains Alderheart’s most iconic structures,
                including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest
                market in the
                Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find
                high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest
                fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across
                Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle
                wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at
                a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend
                sticking to the more respectable shops.</p>
            <p>City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy,
                are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are monitored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates
                are connected
                to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding
                stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for
                transportation are common in the canopy. “Branchroads”,
                specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in
                Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers
                to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys
                connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the
                forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding
                platforms provide birdfolk,
                at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps.
                Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital
                becomes increasingly dangerous.</p>
            <p>Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are
                stationed atop
                reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impressive homes are located in the Boughs District,
                just above the
                market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood
                and have a more modest feel to them.</p>
            <p>The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts
                as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and
                the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes
                here, where there is stable floor beneath them.</p>
            <p>The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers.
                Pathways split
                and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of
                specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the
                main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes
                of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In
                either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay
                lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.</p>
            <p>In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all
                kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart’s wood. They showcase unique wares
                and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy
                markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional
                wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is
                home to inns, taverns,
                and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find
                serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to
                save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi
                supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train
                new recruits to their order.</p>
            <p>Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk
                market, the central support pillars contain tenement style
                housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out
                of the trunk,
                for Alderheart’s traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as
                well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since
                Alderheart was first shaped.</p>
            <p>Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind,
                illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter
                inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built
                near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood,
                most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few
                obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the
                trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways
                via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that
                many cannot afford.</p>
            <p> The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby
                and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There
                are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree
                by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are
                constantly on the lookout for smugglers.</p>
            <p>Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels
                have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the
                roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and
                their development was largely overlooked by city officials in
                the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking
                place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would
                simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart
                itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the
                tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The
                root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping,
                lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison
                of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these
                improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart:
                the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank
                and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are
                mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some
                have been converted into community gathering places. These
                hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid
                from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize
                and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn’t easy, but
                people are trying their best to keep their communities strong,
                as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There
                are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and
                stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the
                roots see it as necessary to survive.</p>

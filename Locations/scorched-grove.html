        <h2 class="main_header">Scorched Grove</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>Centuries ago, the area known as the
                Scorched Grove was once a lush forest of
                calm meadows and peaceful glades. Then,
                the Great Calamity came: a massive forest
                fire that swept through the Grove and
                reduced it to a smoldering, ashen plain.
                The Grove refused to heal. Stranger still,
                the soil beneath the ashen steppes still
                smolders with embers. The air here carries
                a supernatural heat which can exhaust
                travelers or even cause burns depending
                on its fierceness. This hostile landscape is
                home to a variety of curious fire-aspected
                creatures. Certain species, now considered
                native to Humblewood, only appeared
                after the Great Calamity. Most notable are
                the emberbats, which roost in the safety of
                the Grove during the day.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">A Scar on the Forest</h4>
            <p>Accounts of the great blaze have been
                recorded in Humblewood’s history books,
                but the exact cause of the Great Calamity
                remains a mystery. The soils of the Grove
                were tested and found to be distinctively
                suited to channeling evocation energy,
                especially when used with fire spells.</p>
            <p>It was also discovered that the fire-aspected creatures of the
                Grove have extra-planar origins, giving rise to the theory that
                the Calamity was caused by magic. A popular myth told by
                forest-dwellers alleges that the Calamity was caused by the
                appearance of a great primal being of fire and destruction,
                which visited its wrath upon the Wood and then vanished as
                mysteriously as it arrived.</p>
            <p>Whatever its origins, the fire devastated the area and
                displaced thousands of beasts and people from their homes.
                While the inhabitants of the Humblewood know that the
                death and rebirth is part of the natural order of the Wood, the
                Calamity that befell the Grove was clearly unnatural.</p>
            <p>Each year, the Grove pushes on the boundary of the forest,
                growing slightly as its edges are set ablaze by windblown
                embers or fire-infused creatures. The expansion of the Grove
                leaves the newly-burned areas similarly affected, experiencing
                the supernatural qualities of the Grove. This gradual spread has
                increased with a recent spate of forest fires, making those who
                study the Grove nervous.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">A Watchful Eye</h4>
            <p>The Scorched Grove is cared for by a conclave of mystics
                and druids known as the Tenders. Many Tenders are talented
                thinkers and practitioners of natural magic, who have dedicated their lives to understanding the nature
                of the Calamity’s
                effect on the Grove and healing the damage it has caused. They
                believe that through study and communion with nature, the
                natural balance of the energy in the wood can be restored,
                healing the Grove back into the tranquil forest it once was. </p>
            <p>There is much debate about the intent and success of the
                Tenders. High-society perch-dwellers are inclined to think of
                the Tenders as nothing more than “odd-birds,” embarking on
                a fool’s errand. These detractors claim that the Scorched Grove
                is simply a quirk of Humblewood’s natural magic. Much of
                the populace agrees with this point of view, despite educated
                claims to the contrary. Still, given the affinity between nature
                and the cultures of the Wood, Tenders are generally respected
                for the care and reverence they give to the forest.</p>

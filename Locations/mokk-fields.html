        <h2 class="main_header">Mokk Fields</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The confluence of dozens of streams
                and runoff flows have pooled within the
                southwestern lowlands of Humblewood,
                creating a vast wetland. The water here
                gradually filters out to the Talongrip
                Coast and into the sea. Before it does, the
                still, muddy freshwater reservoirs allow
                the Mokk Fields to support a surprising
                array of life.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Uninviting Geography</h4>
            <p>The fringes of the Mokk Fields are
                wreathed with reeds, water lilies, and
                pleasant greenery. Farther into the heart
                of the swamp, travelers find themselves
                inundated by stagnant, foul-smelling
                waters and muddy lowlands with poor
                footholds. Patches of dry stable ground
                are scarce, meaning that the slimy, gnarled
                trees that grow here are rarely suitable to
                support a perch.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Rare Goods</h4>
            <p>The Mokk Fields are not a popular
                travel destination, especially for birdfolk accustomed to towering trees and
                bustling perches. Still, some venture here
                seeking the area’s unique resources. Plants
                and creatures found only in the swamp
                are useful for potion brewing or magical
                reagents, and there is good coin to be made
                for people willing to brave the area’s many
                dangers. Of special note are the slimes,
                dangerous ooze creatures exclusive to this
                environment, whose residue has become a
                sought-after commodity for those with the
                skill to harvest it.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Mokkden Caverns</h4>
            <p>One of the more unlikely landforms of
                the Mokk Fields is the intricate, vast cavern
                system that runs beneath the swamps.
                Years ago, what was thought to be sinkholes were revealed to in fact be tunnel
                entrances to a series of caves. Scouts from
                Winnowing Reach have probed the depths
                to learn more about these caverns. The few
                who have returned reported a significant
                number of slimes. The damp, lightless
                caverns make a perfect home for the amorphous creatures that dwell here.

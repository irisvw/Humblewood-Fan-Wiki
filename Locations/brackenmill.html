            <p>Farming in birdfolk perches is unconventional. In the taller
                perches, fruiting vines and mosses are grown from the branches
                of the trees. The largest and most productive farming perch
                is Brackenmill. Considered a lesser perch due to its proximity to the ground, Brackenmill nevertheless consists of many
                proximate tree-farms that, after years of growth, melded into
                one another. It includes a central hub of shops, trade halls,
                and shipping platforms, all under the watchful eye of the local
                Perch Guard. Some of the farms have even begun to expand
                downward, encompassing small horticultural plots at the
                base of trees. The grounded farms produce luxury goods that
                canâ€™t be grown along the branches, and house corrals for giant
                insects that produce goods ranging from silk to meat.</p>
            <p>Practically every store, tavern, and supplier in Alderheart
                gets their goods from Brackenmill. The movement of agricultural products to vendors around the Wood is overseen by
                a powerful trade guild made up of prominent farm-owning
                families. The guild is comprised of elected leaders and legacy
                members from the most noble of these families. Legacy
                members inherit their position and tend to hold
                lifetime appointments.</p>

        <div class="main_body">
            <p>Winnowing Reach is a relatively new development in the
                Wood. It started as a modest outpost, a last stop for researchers and slime-wranglers bound for the Mokk Fields. When
                folk began disappearing in the swamp, it was decreed that a
                more permanent settlement be constructed to hold a small
                contingent of Perch Guard. To this end, the perch was hastily
                constructed within a small stand of willow trees. In contrast to
                standard perches, a decent portion of the homes and facilities
                here were built entirely on the ground. This closeness to the
                earth creates a feeling of unease and general distaste for birdfolk accustomed to the high perches, but the other races that
                make up the population appreciate the easier access to research
                stations and support buildings</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">The Slime Industry</h4>
            <p>South-west of the Winnowing Reach are the damp slimefilled caves of the Mokkden Caverns. Initially considered a
                hindrance, slimes quickly became a valuable export for the
                Reach. Thanks to the profits from slime-wrangling, Winnowing Reach has grown to include businesses specializing in
                harvesting and shipping slime residue. The trade is mainly
                with the Avium for educational, research, and experimental
                purposes, but other buyers are appearing at a steady pace.
                Alchemists across the Wood find the substances useful in a
                variety of potions, and some healers are beginning to test the
                medicinal application of various slime-based concoctions.</p>

        <div class="main_body">
            <p class="italic">Prerequisite: 7th level</p>
            <p>As an action, you can transform into a <span class="bold">dire wolf</span>, <span class="bold">giant
                    spider</span>, or <span class="bold">giant octopus</span> following the same rules as the polymorph
                spell, but you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.
                You also retain all of your saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature, as
                well as any skill proficiencies that your beast form is physically capable of performing.
                If the creature has the same proficiency bonus as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than
                yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours.
                You maintain the ability to speak and can cast spells that have only a verbal component.</p>
            <p>You maintain this form for 1 hour or until the form drops to 0 hit points, at which point you revert back
                to your normal form.
                If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal
                form. <br>
                Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub_header">Hexshredder</h3>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p class="italic">Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature</p>
            <p>Your fingers grow into bestial claws, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal 1d6 points of
                slashing damage.
                You may add your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls made
                with these unarmed strikes.
                Your unarmed strikes count as pact weapons, in addition to any melee weapons you have chosen, and as
                light weapons for the purposes of two-weapon fighting.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub_header">Primal Summoner</h3>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p class="italic">Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature</p>
            <p>You can summon even more monstrous familiars to your side.
                When you cast the <span class="italic">find familiar</span> spell, you may choose one of the normal
                forms for your familiar, or one of the following special forms:
                <span class="bold">blink dog</span>, <span class="bold">death dog</span>, <span
                    class="bold">panther</span>, or <span class="bold">worg</span>.<br>
                Additionally, you can spend a bonus action on your turn to command your familiar to take the Attack
                action against an opponent of your choice.
            </p>

        <h3 class="sub_header">Hunter's Grimoire</h3>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p class="italic">Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</p>
            <p>A new page appears in your book of shadows, dedicated to your quarry.
                When you recover physical evidence from a creature (a dropt of its blood, a strand of its hair, a feather, tooth or claw, etc.),
                you can offer it to your book of shadows in a special ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform.
                The ritual consumes the offered physical evidence as the name of the creature from which it came is inscribed upon the page in red ink.
                After this ritual, as long as you have your book of shadows with you, you have advantage on any Intelligence checks you make related to the creature.<br>
                Additionally, you can spend 1 minute examining the page to learn one of the following facts about the creature:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Its creature type and alignment</li>
                <li>Any names or aliases it uses</li>
                <li>Its current distance and direction from you (provided it is on the same plane of existence</li>
                <li>Any vulnerabilities or flaws it has</li>
                <li>Whether or not it is wounded</li>
                <li>Whether or not is is suffering from a condition, a curse, or a similar effect, as well as the nature of that effect</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The page can only hold the name of one creature at a time, and you can choose whether to replace the name of the creature currently occupying space on the page each time you complete the ritual.</p>

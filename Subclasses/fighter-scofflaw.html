        <h2 class="main_header">Fighter: Scofflaw</h2>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>A fighter who hits hard and fights dirty, the Scofflaw balks
                at the ideals of honor and tradition, doing what they need to
                survive. Rules are made to be broken, and the Scofflaw extends
                this logic to their fighting style. Using every trick at their
                disposal to gain the upper hand against their foes, the Scofflaw cows their enemy into submission, or
                overwhelms their
                defenses with a single cheap shot</p>
            <p>Scofflaws eventually trust their notorious reputation to do
                much of the work for them, gaining the ability to cause foes
                to quake with a single threat. Scofflaws are a diverse bunch
                that run the gamut from graceful yet deadly knaves to bruiser
                thugs. What ties them together is their belief that there’s no
                such thing as a bad win. </p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Bonus Proficiency</h4>
            <p>When you choose this Martial Archetype at 3rd level, you
                gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:
                Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.
                Alternatively, you may learn Thieves’ Cant.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Intimidating Banter</h4>
            <p>At 3rd level, you are adept at integrating insults and barbs
                into your fighting style. So long as you are in combat, you
                may choose to use Strength or Dexterity to make Charisma
                ability checks. </p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Brutal Brawler</h4>
            <p>At 3rd level, your tavernside scuffles have honed your
                ability to deal damage with just about anything that’s handy.
                You have proficiency with improvised weapons, and treat any
                improvised weapon you handle as if it has the finesse quality. </p>
            <p>Additionally, whenever you hit with an improvised
                weapon, you may spend a bonus action to break it over your
                opponent. Doing this destroys the weapon, but deals the maximum number each of the weapon’s damage dice
                could deal to the target. Any additional dice added to the attack’s damage
                roll are not affected by this ability.</p>
            <p>At 10th level, the improvised weapons you wield become
                even more lethal in your hands. When you spend your bonus
                action to break an improvised weapon over your opponent,
                add an additional 2d6 to the weapon’s base damage dice.</p>
            <p>At 18th level, you have advantage on attacks you make
                with improvised weapons.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Misdirection</h4>
            <p>At 7th level, you are adept at using words and gestures to taunt or fake-out your opponent, turning their
                lack of composure against them. This
                allows you to goad your foe into swinging in ways that can cause them to
                strike their allies, or which leave them open to a counterattack. As a bonus
                action you can misdirect an opponent within 5 feet of you. The target must
                succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your
                proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. On a failure, they must spend their reaction to
                attack a creature of your
                choice within 5 feet of them. If no other creatures are present
                within 5 feet of them, they waste their reaction attacking the
                air where you once were.<br>
                In order for you to misdirect a creature in this way they
                must be able to see, hear, or otherwise be able to understand you.
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Blindside</h4>
            <p>At 10th level, you are truly skilled at exploiting the
                openings you create in combat, hitting off-guard opponents
                with precise blows that are swift and deadly. You may use this
                technique against any creature that hasn’t yet taken a turn in
                combat, or who you have successfully misdirected this turn. You
                may also apply this technique to any attack roll you make with
                advantage. On a hit, you exploit an opening in the target's
                defenses, dealing an extra 5d6 points of damage. Once you use
                this ability, you can’t use it again until you have taken a short
                or long rest.</p>
            <p>At 15th level, the damage dealt by your blindside
                increases to 7d6.<br>
                At 18th level the damage dealt by your blindside increases
                to 9d6. If you have no uses of this ability at the beginning of
                combat on your turn, you regain one use of it. </p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Infamy</h4>
            <p>At 15th level, your reputation precedes you,
                making it easy for you to strike fear into the hearts
                of anyone foolish enough to oppose you.
                As part of your attack action, you can utter
                deadly threats to a single target within
                30 feet of you, causing them to
                become frightened of you for 1
                minute on a failed Wisdom saving throw. An affected target may
                repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending
                the effect on a success. The DC for this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or
                Dexterity modifier. A creature who
                has witnessed or heard tales of your ruthlessness makes this saving
                throw with disadvantage.<br>
                In order for you to use this feature, a creature must be able to see,
                hear, or otherwise be able to understand you. </p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Two For Flinching</h4>
            <p>At 18th level, you have perfected the art of exploiting your opponent’s
                weakness. Whenever you take the attack action against an opponent you
                have successfully misdirected this turn, or an opponent that is afflicted by
                a condition, you may make one additional attack against that opponent.
                You may only use this feature once per round.</p>

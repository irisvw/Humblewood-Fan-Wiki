        <div class="main_body">
            <p>The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen
                dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection
                from predators and shadows within which one can conceal
                themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those
                who would use the cover of darkness to protect others from
                threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings.
                The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery.
                Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through
                the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one
                can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves and their companions safe while
                journeying through
                the darkness.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Eye of Twilight</h4>
            <p>Beginning at 1st level, a divine blessing grants you the ability to see more clearly in dark and dim
                conditions. You can see
                in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
                in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were only dim light.
                You can’t discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray</p>
            <p>When you reach 6th level, you can see in dim light within
                120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or
                nonmagical darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern
                color in the darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
            <p>At 8th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical within 120 feet.</p>
            <p>Finally, at 17th level, your eyes are able to see the truth
                hiding within darkness. You gain the ability to call upon the
                powers of your deity to grant yourself truesight within 120 feet
                of you for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1 minute). Your truesight
                only functions
                while in conditions of magical or nonmagical darkness. Once
                you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you
                have completed a long rest.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Ward of Shadows</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you can create a ward of divine shadows to
                conceal yourself from an attacking enemy. When attacked by
                a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your
                reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as shadows envelop your form. An attacker that can’t
                be blinded is
                immune to this feature.</p>
            <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to
                your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and regain all
                expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Channel Divinity: Invocation of Night</h4>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
                harness the powers of night, clouding the vision of your foes in
                a shroud of darkness. </p>
            <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol causing any
                source of mundane or magical light within 30 feet of you to
                be extinguished. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30
                feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
                who fails the saving throw is blinded for a number of rounds
                equal to your cleric level. A creature blinded in this way gets a
                new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to remove the
                effect. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Improved Ward</h4>
            <p>At 6th level, you can use your Ward of Shadows feature
                whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a
                creature besides yourself.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Veil of Dreams</h4>
            <p>When you reach 8th level, you gain mastery over magical
                sleep. When you cast the sleep spell, add your cleric level to the
                dice you roll to determine how many hit points of creatures
                the spell can affect. </p>
            <p>You may choose the order in which creatures within the
                spell’s area are affected. If the first target chosen has too many
                hit points to be affected, the spell will instead target the next
                creature you have chosen that the spell could affect before
                affecting other targets.<br>
                Additionally, any creature you put to sleep cannot be
                woken until the start of your next turn. Otherwise, the sleep
                spell acts as normal.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Creature of the Night</h4>
            <p>Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate a
                supernatural aura of deep night. It lasts for 1 minute, or until
                you dismiss it using another action. You emit heavily obscuring
                darkness in a 30-foot radius and lightly obscuring shadows
                50 feet beyond that. The darkness and shadows overlap and
                smother existing sources of light. Only light produced by a 9th
                level spell or similarly powerful effect can negate the darkness
                and shadows.</p>
            <p>Enemies within the shadows constantly feel the presence
                of hungry predators watching them, and become frightened
                as long as they remain inside the affected area. Enemies in the
                darkness are both blinded and frightened for as long as they
                remain within its area.</p>

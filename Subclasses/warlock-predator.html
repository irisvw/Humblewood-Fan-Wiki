            <p>Your patron is a primal beast, driven by a bloodthirsty need to hunt.
                These beings tempt creatures to give in to their base instincts and become apex predators.
                Ancient white dragons, demons with a bestial bent, and the Amaranthine Kren have all been known to
                occasionally grant feral powers to those desperate enough to seek their aid.
                Many who strike a pact with a Predator find themselves forever changed, bearing razor teeth and wicked
                claws, an aspect of their predatory patron.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, your patron grants you enhanced tracking skills.
                You gain expertise with the Survival skill, and you add double your proficiency bonus to any Wisdom
                (Survival) skill checks you make.
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Form of the Beast</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you can use your bonus action to channel the ferocity and guile of your patron,
                transforming into a beastly figure.
                For 10 minutes, you gain the following abilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are flooded with adrenaline, feeling nothing besides the thrill of the hunt.
                    You gain temporary hit points equal to two times your warlock level, up to a maximum of 20 temporary
                    hit points at 10th level.
                    These temporary hit points last until the end of your transformation.
                </li>
                <li>Your senses become supernaturally keen.
                    You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth), Wisdom (Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks you
                    make to track or stalk your prey.</li>
                <li>You sprout a set of pointed teeth and razor-sharp claws, which are natural weapons you can use to
                    make unarmed strikes against creatures within 5 feet of you.
                    You have proficiency with these weapons and can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and
                    damage rolls made using these natural weapons.
                    On a hit, your bite deals 1d6 piercing damage, and your claws deal 1d4 slashing damage.
                    If you already had a bite or claw attack (talon attacks count as claw attacks), its damage increases
                    by one step (a d4 becomes a d6, a d6 becomes a d8, etc.).
                    As a bonus action, after making a bite attack, you can make a claw attack.</li>
                <li>Starting at 5th level, your muscles strengthen, and your movements quicken.
                    You can now make two claw attacks using your bonus action after you have made a bite attack with
                    your action.
                    Additionally, at 5th level, you can take the Dash or Hide action as a bonus action while you are in
                    your Form of the Beast.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can use this feature twice per short or long rest. At 6th level, your transformation lasts for 1 hour
                instead of 10 minutes.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Thrill of the Hunt</h4>
            <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to feast on the vitality of your foes while you are in your Form of
                the Beast.
                Once per turn, when you hit a creature with your bite attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra
                3d6 points of necrotic damage.
                You regain a number of hit points equal to the total damage dealt with this attack. <br>
                Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you score a critical hit with a bite or claw
                attack or until you finish a short or long rest.<br>
                At 10th level, the extra necrotic damage provided by this feature increases to 5d6.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Fearsome Presence</h4>
            <p>At 10th level, you learn how to channel the presence of a frightful beast, even when not transformed.
                You can use your action to cause each hostile creature you can see within a 30-foot radius to succeed on
                a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute.
                Creatures who fail their saving throw are also restrained until the end of your next turn.
                A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
                itself on a success.<br>
                Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Uncaged Beast</h4>
            <p>Upon reaching 14th level, you become even more ferocious when pushed to your limits.
                When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your eaction to immediately transform into your Form of the Beast and then make one bite or claw attack at an enemy within 5 feet of you.<br>
            Additionally, while transformed into your Form of the Beast, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a bite or claw attack against that creature.</p>

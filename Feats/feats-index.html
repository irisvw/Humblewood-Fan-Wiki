            <p class="italic">Prerequisite: Glide trait</p>
            <p>Years of practice or an innate talent have made you adept at
                gliding. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You no longer need to move at least 10 feet to perform
                    long and high jumps. You may choose whether the jump
                    uses your Strength or Dexterity score for determining
                    height or distance, and you double the distance you would
                    normally leap in either case.</li>
                <li>You may take the Dash action while gliding to fly an additional distance up to your movement speed
                </li>
                <li>You may change direction freely while gliding, and may
                    gain up to 10 feet of altitude once before you finish
                    your descent. </li>

        <h3 class="sub_header">Bandit Cunning</h3>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>Your time as a bandit has granted you a sense for danger, and
                made you skilled at sizing up opponents. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you are asked to make a saving throw, you may
                    spend your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier as an
                    additional bonus to the saving throw. You cannot use this
                    ability again until you have completed a long rest.</li>
                <li>During combat, you can use your action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against any
                    creature you have
                    seen fight. As long as you succeed against a DC of 10 +
                    their challenge rating, you can learn one useful fact of your
                    choice about the target’s combat abilities. Choose from:
                    <ul>
                        <li>one damage resistance or immunity</li>
                        <li>one condition immunity</li>
                        <li>one special ability possessed by the creature that
                            either does damage, or prevents damage</li>
                        <li>one option under their attack, legendary, or
                            reaction actions</li>
                        <li>one special sense they possess</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="sub_header">Heavy Glider</h3>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p class="italic">Prerequisite: Glide trait</p>
            <p>You were either born with great strength, or trained hard to
                allow yourself to glide under circumstances most would find
                impossible. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may glide while holding a heavy weapon and wearing
                    heavy armor as long as you aren’t encumbered.</li>
                <li>You may choose to land your glide in a space occupied by
                    a hostile creature that is Large or smaller. If you do so, you
                    may roll an opposed Strength check against the creature.
                    On a success, you push them 10 feet away and knock them
                    prone with the force of your impact. On a failure you land
                    in the nearest un-occupied space.

        <h3 class="sub_header">Opportunistic Thief</h3>
        <div class="main_body">
            <p>You have learned the tricks of the trade of thievery, allowing
                you to exploit opportunities for pick-pocketing both in and
                out of combat. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Dexterity score by 1.</li>
                <li>When a creature fails a melee attack roll against you in
                    combat, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check
                    against a DC equal to 10 + the target’s Dexterity modifier.
                    On a success, you may steal any one item that is not being
                    held or worn by the target.</li>
                <li>Whenever you successfully use your Sleight of Hand skill
                    outside of combat to steal an object, you may immediately
                    conceal it flawlessly on your person, or put another object
                    you possess in its place.</li>

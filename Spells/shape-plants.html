            <p>You call upon gentle natural magics to alter the growth 
                of plants. Any plant life you can see within range that fits 
                within a 5-foot cube can take on whatever shape you desire. 
                Additionally, if the plant is a bramble or capable of growing 
                thorns, you may turn the affected area into difficult terrain, 
                causing 2d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet moved 
                through the area you shaped. You may also increase or decrease 
                the number of flowers, vines, leaves, thorns, branches, or fruits 
                produced by any plant you shape.</p>
            <p>After one hour, the magic of your spell fades, and the plant 
                resumes its normal shape. If you can use speak with plants 
                (or a similar ability) to communicate with the plant, you may 
                persuade it to retain its new form. Different plants have different feelings and attitudes, and if the form is too different from 
                its natural shape it is likely to decline. If the plant accepts, at 
                the GMâ€™s discretion, it will retain the
                form you have sculpted it into, in which case the effect 
                becomes permanent. </p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">At Higher Levels. </span>When you cast this spell using a spell 
                slot above 4th level, the size of the cube of plant life you can 
                affect with the spell increases by an additional 5 feet for every 
                slot level above 4th.</p>

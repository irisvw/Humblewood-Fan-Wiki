            <p>You create two small stars that orbit you. They twinkle
                pleasantly, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius centered
                on you. The stars protect you. If a creature within 5 feet of
                you hits you with a melee attack they must make a Wisdom
                saving throw or take 1d8 points of radiant damage for each star
                orbiting you. </p>
            <p>Once per round, on your turn, you may use your action
                to cause a star to streak towards an enemy, expending it as it
                explodes in a blinding flash. Make a ranged spell attack against
                an enemy within 120 feet, dealing 4d8 points of radiant
                damage on a hit. The target must then make a Constitution
                saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn.<br>
                The spell ends when either its duration expires, you fall
                unconscious, or you have expended all of your stars.</p>
            <p><span class="bold italic">At Higher Levels. </span>When you cast this spell using a spell
                slot above 4th level, you may create one additional star for
                every two slot levels above 4th. For each additional star
                orbiting you, the radius of dim light centered on you increases
                by 5 feet.</p>

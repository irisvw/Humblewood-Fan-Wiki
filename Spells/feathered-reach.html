            <p class="italic">3rd-level transmutation</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Casting Time: </span>1 action <br>
            <span class="bold">Range: </span>Self<br>
            <span class="bold">Components: </span> S, M (a small feather)<br>
            <span class="bold">Duration: </span>1 minute</p>
            <p>You transform your arms into powerful wings, and your 
                fingers into long, graceful feathers. The effects of this spell 
                last 1 minute, at which point the feathers gradually fall out, 
                causing you to float gently to the ground as your arms return 
                to their original form. This spell confers a number of benefits 
                upon the caster: 
            <ul>
                <li>As a bonus action, you can fly up to double your movement speed. You must land once you finish your movement, although you do not take fall damage while this 
                    spell is active, as your feathered arms bear you gently to 
                    the ground. </li>
                <li>You can use your powerful feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to half your movement speed. 
                    You can do this once during your turn and may use it in 
                    conjunction with a regular jump.</li>
                <li>When falling, you can use your reaction to stiffen your 
                    arms, and glide on the wind. You may fly up to your movement speed, in any direction, choosing where you land.</li>
                <li>You gain advantage on all athletics checks used to make a 
                    long or high jump. You do not need to move 10 feet before 
                    you jump to gain distance, and you triple the distance you 
                    would jump normally.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>In order to benefit from this spell your hands must 
                be free of shields and heavy weapons, and you cannot 
                be encumbered.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Casting Time: </span>1 action <br>
            <span class="bold">Range: </span>Self (15-foot radius, 15 feet high)<br>
            <span class="bold">Components: </span> V, S, M (a dab of pitch and a bag of

            <span class="bold">Duration: </span>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
            <p>You shroud the area surrounding you in a sphere 
                of night sky, dotted with miniature stars. The twilight 
                conceals your allies, but clearly illuminates your enemies. </p>
            <p>The area affected by this spell is lightly obscured by 
                magical shadow, within which small constellations softly 
                twinkle. Aside from these stars, only light produced by 
                a spell of 3rd level or higher can properly illuminate any 
                area inside the sphere. Nonmagical light does not function inside the sphere, and all other forms of magical 
                radiance can only produce dim light in a 5-foot space.</p>
                <p>When you cast this spell you may designate any number 
                    of creatures you can see to be concealed by the supernatural 
                    shadows while in the sphere. A concealed creature has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when inside the sphere and 
                    may attempt to hide at any time. Because the area of the spell 
                    is lightly obscured, creatures within the spell’s area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see those 
                    outside of it. </p>
            <p>All other creatures in the area are dazzled by the light of 
                the miniature stars, causing them to have disadvantage on all 
                perception checks inside the sphere. When such a creature 
                enters the spell’s area for the first time, or starts its turn there, 
                it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the 
                end of its turn.</p>

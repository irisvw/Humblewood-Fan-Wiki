            <p><span class="bold">Casting Time: </span>10 minutes; Special, see text<br>
            <span class="bold">Range: </span>Self; Special, see text<br>
            <span class="bold">Components: </span> : V, S, M (a holy symbol of the Amaranthine); Special, see text<br>
            <span class="bold">Duration: </span>24 hours</p>
            <p>You call upon the power of an Amaranthine to grant 
                yourself insight into the Great Rhythm that moves all 
                things. When you cast this spell, roll two d20s, and record 
                what you rolled. For each die, choose either attack roll, 
                skill check, or saving throw. You can choose each option 
                multiple times. For the next 24 hours, you may substitute 
                any roll of an ally or enemy you can see within 60 feet 
                with one of the recorded numbers that matches the type of 
                roll you wish to replace (attack roll, skill check, or saving 
                throw). The target still adds any relevant modifiers to this 
                number, but otherwise treat the substituted number as the 
                number they rolled.</p>
            <p>To do this, you must spend a reaction to present your 
                holy symbol and invoke the name of the Amaranthine 
                whose energies you called upon. You can do this anytime 
                after the skill check, saving throw or attack has been rolled, 
                but before the outcome of the event has been determined. 
                The spell ends after 24 hours have passed, or when both 
                dice have been expended.</p>

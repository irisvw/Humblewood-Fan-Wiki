            <p>Reya, the Amaranthine of wind, is depicted as a great
                hawk wrapped in a cloak of swirling clouds, wielding
                a great longbow in her talons. She is the patron of the
                raptors, and is believed to have endowed them with their
                superior senses. </p>
            <p>
                The wind is free, streaming unimpeded across land and sea.
                Reya embodies this freedom. Her spirit glides through trees,
                over mountains, and out to the four corners of the world. She
                is the Amaranthine of exploration; her holy symbol forms
                a compass. Free-spirited folk who feel an insatiable urge to
                wander and roam the lands have been touched by her winds. </p>
            <p>
                Reya is a skilled hunter, credited with the invention of the
                bow, a gift she passed down to the birdfolk. She is also honored
                for her skills in navigating wild country and surviving off the
                land. Travelers undertaking long journeys pray to be blessed by
                a portion of her talents, to assist them in the perilous wilderness. Reya watches over those who embark
                on daring expeditions, protecting travelers and presenting them with challenges
                to make their journey all the more memorable. </p>
            <p>
                Reya is worshiped by hunters, travelers, sailors, and
                explorers. She is revered by wandering bards, who carry
                their journeys home in the form of songs and tales.</p>

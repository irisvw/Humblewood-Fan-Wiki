            <p>An Amaranthine of heroism and valor, Gaspard is “The
                Champion”. In life, Gaspard was a great jerbeen leader.
                Upon his death, the Great Rhythm took him, and his
                spirit ascended as an Amaranthine. It is believed he was chosen
                to serve as an example of greatness, one to inspire others for
                generations to come. Tales of his mortal adventures have
                earned him renown. He traveled the whole of Everden, with
                his closest companions, slaying monsters, unseating tyrants,
                and bringing peace and prosperity wherever he roamed.</p>
            <p>
                Gaspard’s followers believe the actions of an individual
                ripple outwards, affecting those around us, which in turn
                can embolden anyone to achieve greatness. The example of
                Gaspard teaches jerbeen to affect others with acts of courage,
                heroism, and kindness.</p>
            <p>
                At times, Gaspard has been at odds with other Amaranthine. Before he ascended, there is a tale of him
                meeting Kren,
                where he was forced to show no sign of fear, lest she eat him
                and his companions. Thankfully, his composure kept his
                group strong, and in turn their bravery kept him strong. They
                escaped with their lives.</p>
            <p>
                Gaspard’s example has lead many to heed the paladin’s
                call. Gaspard is worshiped by warriors who seek to match his
                exploits, as well as bards who seek to inspire others through the
                telling of heroic tales. <br>
                Humblefolk hold summer festivals in his honor. These
                holidays include storytelling, puppet shows, and magnificent
                jousts where armored jerbeens mounted on tamed wolves put
                on a spectacle of courage and daring before the crowds. </p>

            <p>The Amaranthine of predation and guile, Kren is
                portrayed as a great fox-like beast, whose form is
                usually obscured by shadows. The only known parts
                of her form are her fangs and her eyes, glinting as they catch
                the light. Kren appears in many tales, as often a villain as a
                hero, and even then it is rare that her motives are laudable.
                Yet, one can learn from Kren, for her stories often demonstrate
                how hubris can be exploited, how heroes can be laid low, and
                how there is no weapon so deadly as flattery.</p>
            <p>
                The patron spirit of the vulpin, Kren teaches them to walk
                the line between savagery and sophistication, and how and
                when each should be used. For many other humblefolk she
                demonstrates the value of cunning, showing that no creature is
                so wise or mighty that they cannot be taken advantage of.</p>
            <p>
                Stories of her origin are often vague and contradictory.
                A popular vulpin myth tells that Kren came from a time
                before life existed on Everden. That she was an ancient force,
                ready to feast on a world full of new and fresh meat, who
                simply awoke when the Dawnmother and Nightfather set
                creation in motion. Others believe she was the first vulpin,
                who ascended from an ordinary fox. As the story goes, Kren
                tricked the Dawnmother into allowing her to watch over the
                Amaranthine’s two divine feathers. Kren ate a single feather
                and became the Amaranthine of guile. This is why the Dawnmother only carries one feather in her beak</p>
            <p>
                Kren isn’t worshiped in the same way as other Amaranthine. Rather, Kren is invoked in stories to teach
                the dangers of
                vainglory. Many outlaws keep shrines to her patronage. These
                individuals include thieves, smugglers, and purveyors of black
                market goods. Priests of Kren use her stories to teach others
                how to be crafty and cunning, but also to be cautious of the
                wiles of others. There are those, however, who invoke Kren
                for dark rites and rituals to gain power for themselves. Kren is
                always ready to make bargains with such supplicants, but all
                who do are fated to be devoured by her when their lives finally
                come to an end</p>

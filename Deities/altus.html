            <p>Altus is depicted as a powerful horned owl with white
                feathers, who rides across the sky pouring thunderheads
                from his chalice. Altus is a pragmatic Amaranthine,
                believing that strength is cultivated through enduring hardships, overcoming challenges, and testing
                mortal limitations.
                Stories of Altusâ€™ tenacity and endurance abound, including the
                time he captured the moon as a gift to Ardea, and the time he
                made the mountains by lifting the earth. Themes of bravery
                and strength are common in his myths.</p>
            <p>
                Altus resides with Tyton in the lands of death. Legend says
                that every year Altus makes the long and arduous journey to
                bring winter storms and foul weather. According to myth, this
                is as much to test the endurance of his people as it is to test
                himself by crossing the divide between life and death, which
                binds the Great Rhythm. Summers with especially bad weather
                are credited to Altus, who made the trip early to keep his
                people strong and vigilant.</p>
            <p>
                Altus is the patron Amaranthine of the strig, and is celebrated by them annually in a great winter
                festival. Games and
                activities during this festival challenge entrants with feats of
                strength and endurance. No official winner is declared, and all
                who participate are lauded for their courage and given a special
                place at the feasting table.</p>
            <p>
                Altus usually finds veneration among warriors or
                athletes, but also among common people who pray for
                strength to withstand personal hardships, bad harvests,
                and natural disasters.</p>

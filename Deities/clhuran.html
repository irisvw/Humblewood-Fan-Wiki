            <p>Fickle and unpredictable, Clhuran is the Amaranthine of
                fortune, magic, and fate. He is commonly represented
                in dual profile: on one side as a jester with bangles and
                bells, carrying a marotte, and on the other as an executioner,
                weilding an axe. Clhuran’s double profile illustrates his fickle
                nature, and the nature of fate. Clhuran’s tales are of his luck,
                mirth, and jest, though he is also known to be a capricious
                Amaranthine. His normally pleasant demeanor can shift at a
                moment’s notice to melancholy or jealousy</p>
            <p>
                Clhuran teaches that everyone is tied to the web of fate
                by invisible strands. Each thread extends out into the cosmos,
                darting and weaving as it moves to the Rhythm. Clhuran’s
                wisdom is to allow yourself to be moved by the threads of
                fate, to feel the pull of possibility around you, and to act in
                accordance with their whims. Even misfortune may lead one
                to an important place, or so Clhuran says. Good times and bad
                times are all part of the tapestry of fate, and there is a strength
                that can be drawn from accepting one’s destiny. According to
                his teachings, good luck is nothing more than being open to
                change, and following the will of the universe.</p>
            <p>
                Lumas are seen to be Clhuran’s chosen, because of their
                connection to the threads of fate, which manifests as a natural
                magical talent. Arcane spellcasters, seers, and fortune tellers
                pray to Clhuran for insight into the will of the universe. Bards,
                artists, and writers also pay homage to Clhuran, because of his
                wild moods and connection to emotion. They hope to follow
                their fate to events of great import, which may be immortalized by their art.</p>

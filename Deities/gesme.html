            <p>An enigmatic figure, Gesme is the Amaranthine who
                governs knowledge, insight, and inspiration. She
                represents fire, the spark which both inspires and
                destroys. She acknowledges that delving into the unknown
                requires the courage to be burned. </p>
            <p>
                Gesme is depicted as a raven, whose body is alight with the
                flames of knowledge. In her talons she carries a staff of burning
                oak which lights the way for scholars. Gesme is best known
                for stealing fire from Ardea’s sun and bringing it to Everden,
                burning her feathers black in the process. <br>
                Her stolen flame brought fire and the light of reason to the
                world. While this act earned her a place among the Amaranthine, many feel it was a folly to give fire to
                mortals.</p>
            <p>
                She is the patron spirit of the corvums. Legend has it that
                all corvums have at least one black feather, symbolic of Gesme’s
                seared plumage.<br>
                Gesme teaches that chaos and innovation are part of a
                great cycle. Each discovery spawns a new mystery, which leads
                to further discovery in a never-ending loop, in which the old
                becomes fodder for the new. She is a symbol of all that birdfolk
                can achieve if they dare to push boundaries
                and harness their creativity.</p>
            <p>
                First among her followers are those who study the arcane
                arts or experiment with magical forces, such as scholars and
                mages. She is also revered by artisans, and craftspeople of
                every kind. Blacksmiths in particular understand the danger
                and power of working directly with flames and pay her special
                reverence. Her followers pray to her for the spark of creativity
                that will ignite the fires of creation.</p>

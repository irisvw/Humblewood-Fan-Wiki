            <p>Henwin, the patron spirit of hedges, is venerated by
                humblefolk of all kinds. They are the Amaranthine of
                balance, and teach that all things in the forest must
                be respected, as all are connected in a great web of kindness.
                It is thanks to the sun that the plants grow, and because the
                plants grow, all living things have food. Decayed food turns
                into soil, which nourishes more life. The teachings of Henwin
                ask followers to take into consideration the many kindnesses
                which brought each of them into being and nourished them
                throughout their lives.</p>
            <p>
                It is only fitting, then, that Henwin is said to be a hedgehog who spends their life in the forest.
                Storytellers say that
                they reside in an ancient part of the world, hidden from the
                eyes of most mortals, where they inhabit a tangle of roots from
                every forest that has ever grown. Here they tend to a garden
                of moss, fungi, and insects, helping to keep the living roots
                healthy. Henwin ensures that even the husks of withered plants
                can provide for the vegetation and creatures who rely on dead
                things for sustenance.</p>
            <p>
                Unlike other Amaranthine, Henwin is not described as
                male or female. Being a spirit of balance, they are considered to
                possess traits of all genders. They are often depicted carrying
                a yellow rose, which is their symbol. When a yellow rose
                blooms, it is said to be Henwin, blessing a forest with the
                beauty of their quiet grace. These roses are often given as
                tokens of friendship.</p>
            <p>
                Henwin teaches understanding, and respect for the web
                of kindness that connects all life. If death is dealt indiscriminately, the web may become damaged.
                Although it is resilient,
                the web is still as fragile as one made from spider’s silk. It is the
                duty of all who follow Henwin to strengthen the web and to
                help maintain the balance which supports all living things.</p>
            <p>Henwin is followed by druids, who take the message of
                nature’s web of kindness to heart. Henwin’s druids can be
                found protecting groves and leading communities, keeping both safe from those with harmful intentions.
                Priests of
                Henwin often invoke the Amaranthine Henwin’s name to
                protect the fauna, flora, and folk under their care. Gardeners
                honor Henwin by keeping plots filled with a diverse array of
                complementary plant and insect life.</p>

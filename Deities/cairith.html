            <p>An Amaranthine of vigor and strength, Cairith is the
                patron spirit of the cervans. The energy that Cairith
                oversees is the cause of slow, steady growth and longevity. In living beings, this force manifests as
                the ability to run,
                jump, grow, and become strong. Ancient forests, where plants
                cover the trees and giant beasts are endowed with the intelligence to speak, are seen as signs of
                Cairith’s blessing. Cairith
                teaches that adversity brings strength, but his teachings differ
                from those of Altus. Altus encourages his followers to seek out
                challenges, where Cairith sees life itself as a perpetual struggle.
                The true test of survival is always against oneself and one’s own
                limits. By persevering in spite of these limits, Cairith counsels
                his adherents to triumph over the forces of death. This struggle
                must one day end, of course, and so the followers of Cairith
                seek to honor the daily triumphs of life as they happen. An
                existence is considered well-spent if it was lived unflinchingly,
                even in the face of sorrows and hardships. Cairith adamantly
                opposes necromancy as those made undead truly cannot appreciate life’s struggle</p>
            <p>
                Cairith is described as a mighty stag with antlers covered in
                moss and flowering vines. He is massively tall, and wherever he
                walks plants sprout from the earth. Where others see a tangle
                of vegetation, Cairith sees the plan of nature unfolding. All
                cervans profess a kinship to Cairith. But rather than claiming
                him as a direct ancestor, he is seen as a guardian spirit. Some
                say he was the first to be born from the land when the Dawnmother gave Everden life. </p>
            <p>
                Cairith guided the first cervans, and blessed them with
                many gifts so that they might survive in the primitive forest.
                One of these gifts, the power of The Sight, is attributed to
                Cairith. Certain cervans are gifted with The Sight, and this
                allows them to glimpse events that have occurred in the past,
                present, and future. </p>
            <p>
                Cairith finds reverence among rangers, druids, healers, and
                community leaders. Paladins invoke his dogma to give heart
                to those they defend. Cervan diviners gifted with the Sight call
                upon Cairith in their rituals. Cairith also has many followers among common people, especially
                humblefolk who have
                suffered hardships.</p>

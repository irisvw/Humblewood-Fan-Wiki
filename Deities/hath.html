            <p>Known as “The Uncaring”, “The All-Knowing Stars”, and
                “The Whisperer”, Hath is an Amaranthine that humblefolk and birdfolk alike struggle to understand. In
                spite
                of this conflict, Hath is revered by the mapach. According to
                them, Hath was a constellation of stars who listened carefully
                to the Nightfather. In ancient times, the Nightfather spoke
                and spread his vast wisdom across the primordial darkness.
                He spoke of night, of time, and of the worlds beyond life.
                The constellation listened and grew wise, too wise to remain
                as stars. Thus, it became a part of the Great Rhythm as the
                Amaranthine of fear, doubt, and secrets. This is why, the tellers
                say, the Nightfather no longer speaks.</p>
            <p>
                Ever since, Hath has whispered its unsettling secrets to the
                creatures below, speaking quietly so the other stars cannot hear.
                Mapachs were not the first to hear its voice, but they claim
                to be the first to truly make use of its secrets. While priests of
                Hath do not necessarily “hear” the words of the stars, mapachs
                believe that Hath speaks in subtle ways. Those frightened
                while traveling at night or caught in dangerous situations
                are bestowed with cautious and crafty thoughts by Hath. If
                heeded, one may survive. If ignored, one may die. Either way,
                Hath, The Uncaring, is apathetic.</p>
            <p>
                The stars teach the importance of trusting in oneself and
                keeping your wits about you, even in dire situations. When a
                mapach gets a shiver of premonition, something they could
                never have known, it is said to be the whispers of Hath they
                have heard.</p>
            <p>
                Hath has few followers, and most are mapachs. Rangers
                and travelers passing through dangerous parts of the Wood
                at night often pay homage to the All-Knowing Stars. While
                some pray to this Amaranthine for guidance, others hope not
                to hear Hath’s voice, as the stars only whisper to those in peril.
                Warlocks make pacts with this Amaranthine for knowledge of
                the worlds beyond life. Most consider this practice to be rather
                reckless—The Uncaring is known to exact a terrible price for
                such secrets. Some lose their mind delving into the vast reservoir of knowledge that Hath is all too
                eager to supply.</p>

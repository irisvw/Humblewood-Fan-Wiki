        <div class="main_body">
            <p>Aerisi Kalinoth (died Kythorn 16, 1491) was the "queen" of the Cult of the Howling Hatred. She appeared
                to be an Avariel, but her wings were likely illusionary. She was described as a winged elf, with dark black hair, and a very fancy diadem. She was also the wielder of Windvane.</p>

            <h3 class="sub_header">Life</h3>
            <p>Not much is known about her life. She was a worshipper of Tiamat, and likely Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air. She was well-respected within her own ranks, though outsiders usually disliked her attitude.</p>
            <h4 class="sub_sub_header">Death</h4>
            <p>Aerisi Kalinoth was killed within her own throne room on Kythorn 16, 1491, by four adventurers who had previously managed to gain her trust by swearing an oath to Tiamat themselves.
                Right before her demise, she pleaded with Tiamat, who granted her a draconic transformation. Upon her death, her body disintegrated.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub_header">Personal Life</h3>
            <p>Aerisi appeared to have good relations with Thurl Merosska.
                She was one of the four elemental Lords, and therefore served Azar Kul. It is presumed they communicated regularly, though she didn't appear to be in possession of a sending stone connected to him.

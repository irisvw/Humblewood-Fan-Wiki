            <p>Hanera is the birdfolk Amaranthine closest to
                nature. She holds dominion over all things that
                grow within the earth. While Ardea is the animating
                force of life, Hanera is the guiding heart that gives life purpose
                and meaning. She encourages birdfolk to see the world not
                only from the treetops, but from the loam and
                all the tiny living things beneath. Everything, Hanera teaches,
                is connected as part of a vast continuum of life stretching back
                to the earliest ancestors.</p>
            <p>
                Hanera is depicted as a pheasant with feathers that fade to
                green as they morph into plants and flowers. She is the patron
                Amaranthine of the gallus, and is invoked when growing
                anything from the soil. </p>
            <p>
                As a spirit of both earth and hearth, Hanera governs
                the bonds that connect people to one another and to nature.
                She is celebrated at feasts, and during ceremonies involving the
                sharing of food. <br>
                Her generosity and kindness are renowned, as is her
                intolerance for evil. It is Haneraâ€™s will that evil be challenged
                wherever it is found. Not with violence, but with acts of
                compassion. Those who harbor darkness in their hearts require
                the warmth of friends, family, and shelter to heal,
                and so Hanera teaches birdfolk never to give up on each other.
                Even the most wicked among us can be healed with love.</p>
            <p>
                Hanera is worshiped by farmers and druids, but many
                clerics tend shrines in her honor, mostly in modest woodland
                villages. Her holy symbol is often hung above the doorway,
                inside a home, to bless the dwelling and all those within.</p>

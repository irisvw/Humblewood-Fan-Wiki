            <p>Ardea is depicted as a great stork with shining golden
                feathers, wreathed in flowers or other plant life. She
                is the Amaranthine of the sun who watches over the
                flora and fauna of Everden and provides them with light and
                energy to grow. </p>
            <p>
                Ardea’s light is present in all living things, from the tiniest
                sprouting seed to the mightiest beast. Her light also represents
                love and kindness, which every creature is believed to possess.
                All birdfolk are said to be Ardea’s children, and many think
                she appears as a stork to demonstrate her maternal love for
                them—although she is speculated to appear in a different form
                to each woodland race. </p>
            <p>
                When she vacates the sky she rests in a plane of pure light
                and life. There, great celestial storks carry out her will, and act
                as her messengers in the mortal world. An old folk story relates
                that Ardea sends these storks to fly unnoticed into Everden,
                where they place her animating light into unhatched eggs. This
                is why birdfolk often refer to her as “Mother Stork”. </p>
            <p>
                She is worshiped by good aligned characters of every sort:
                poets write of the love she has bestowed upon the world,
                priests ask her to watch over the newly born, and farmers pray
                to her for good harvests and light winters.</p>

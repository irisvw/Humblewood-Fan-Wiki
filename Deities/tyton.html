            <p>Tyton is depicted as an immense black barn owl. It
                is believed he ushers the night in by spreading his
                wings over the sky. Tyton also governs time, memory,
                and death. As the sun must set, so too must the light of life
                give way to the darkness of the grave. Rather than being seen
                as a frightful figure, Tyton is looked upon as kind; he greets
                the old, the frail, and those at the end of their lives as familiar friends, guiding their souls
                peacefully back into the Great
                Rhythm, where they will be reborn, in time.</p>
            <p>
                When not occupying the sky, it is believed Tyton resides in
                the lands of death. Not an afterlife, rather this is a part of the
                Great Rhythm where everything is cold, dark, and eternally
                still. His abode lies beyond the parts of the Rhythm associated
                with life, a divide impossible for mortals to cross. Even other
                Amaranthine find travel to the lands of death difficult, except
                for Altus, who resides there with Tyton for most of the year,
                only leaving to bring winter storms across the land.</p>
            <p>
                In addition to guiding the souls of the dead, Tyton is
                associated with the coming of old age, and the keeping of
                memory. When Tyton is invoked at funerals, it is to remember
                those who have passed, and to recall their lives and deeds. He
                watches the living, patiently observing all beneath him. Tyton
                can learn all there is to know of your life by watching your
                dreams. Because Tyton watches the living from birth to death,
                he is known as “Father Owl”. </p>
            <p>
                Tyton frowns upon those who would seek to enslave the
                souls of the dead using necromantic magics, and those who
                would desecrate the tombs of the deceased, as these actions
                corrupt the natural cycle.</p>
